# Story: Get my current contribution streak

## Use Case 01

As a system user

In order to get know for how many days in sequence I have contributed in github

Given an ordered list of objects with date and number of contributions

When I check my contribution streak

Then it should return how many days in a row I have contributed starting from today and going backwards
